  Hi! I’m Mikołaj, a Software Engineer II and a student at Warsaw University of Technology, with a passion for music. My professional journey includes an internship at Allegro and Bridgestone and a current position as a Software Engineer II at Box. My technical expertise encompasses Java, DevOps, Kubernetes, Kafka, Spring, and React. Alongside my engineering roles, I’ve competed in coding competitions, securing 1st and 3rd place in the Best Hacking League and 2nd place in the Ensemble AI Hackathon. Academically, I'm focusing on machine learning, particularly within my thesis on “Conditioning of Musical Generative Models.” <br/>
  Thanks for stopping by! <br/>
